# 🌳 Recover Binary Search Tree

🔗 **Problem Link:** [Recover Binary Search Tree →](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/description/)

## 📝 Description

You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where **exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake**. Recover the tree **without changing its structure**.

Your task is to **restore the BST** by swapping the values of the two incorrect nodes back to their correct positions.

---

## 💡 Example

```txt
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

Explanation: 3 and 1 were swapped. The tree should be [1,3,null,null,2].
```

## 📚 Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`
- `-2³¹ <= Node.val <= 2³¹ - 1`
