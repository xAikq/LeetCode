# 🧹 Remove Element

🔗 **Problem Link:** [Remove Element →](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

## 📝 Description

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, **remove all occurrences** of `val` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.

Since it is in-place, you must do this by **modifying the input array directly**, and use **O(1) extra memory**.

Return the new length of the array after removal. You do **not need to consider** elements beyond the returned length.

## 💡 Example

```txt
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2, 2, _, _]

Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

## 📚 Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`
