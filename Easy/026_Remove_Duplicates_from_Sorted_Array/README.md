# 🧹 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

🔗 **Problem Link:** [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array →](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

## 📝 Description

Given an integer array `nums` **sorted in non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it must be done in-place, you must do this by **modifying the input array directly** and using **O(1) extra memory**.

Return the number of unique elements. The first part of the array should contain the unique elements, and you do **not need to consider** elements beyond the returned length.

## 💡 Example

```txt
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 2, nums = [1, 2, _]

Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

## 📚 Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order
